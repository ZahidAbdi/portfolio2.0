        <p className='a-desc'>
          I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Front End Web
          Development Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful. Using my imagination in
          tandem with my skills I have the power to make my ideas come to life.
          I want to work on a team with great programmers and learn as much as I
          can. I want to make my mom proud ðŸ˜Š

        <p className='a-desc'>
          When I'm not coding, I'm typically found exploring the world with my
          camera or deep into a good book. From hip-hop to classical, I love
          dancing and expressing myself. I enjoy getting lost in the music and
          relieving some stress.
